UPDATE: April 10 2015

So this is the first time I'm uploading all my stuff (at least as far as I can tell). 

I've been doing everything with my local apache server, so maybe some stuff doesn't work
with the CS servers right now. I'll have to make some adjustments in the coming days.
Basically, you can see the users.csv and topic.csv files have some sample elements right
now. The formatting style should be clear.

When MyFacebookPage.py loads, it takes a username (of course), which right now is just a
variable declared at the beginning of the script. You can play around with it if you like.
I don't have any auto-reload happening right now, as apparently that's a requirement, and
I didn't know. I do, however, have some funny pages for success/failure pages (at least I
think they're funny). Don't try adding users that exist, because you'll break the feed page.
Python apparently writes to files differently in write mode than in append mode, and I'm still figuring out
the quirks.


Anyway, that should be all. I've only seen the layout in Safari, so maybe it looks all
ugly in Firefox, Opera, IE, or (god-forbid) Chrome (damn memory-hog).
